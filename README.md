#### Workout logger app

As someone who regularly goes to the gym I have never been able to find an efficient app that allows me to track my workouts with ease. So I used this as inspiration for my final project.

My main issue with gym apps is they all try to offer too many features. They're hard-to-use, slow and complicated. What I want my app to be is simple and quick-to-use in the gym so that users can still focus on their workouts.

One thing that all gym apps are missing is a feature whereby users can compare the previous workout's reps, sets, and weights with the workout they are currently doing. To my knowledge no gym tracker app has both the current workout and the previous one's statistics both easily accessible to the user in a single view. This feature is dedicated for users like me who want to be aware of what reps, sets, and weights they used the previous time so that they can apply progressive overload and get stronger with each and every workout.
